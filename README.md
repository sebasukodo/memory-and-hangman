# Memory and Hangman  

This repository contains two small web games I created about five years ago using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**:

- ðŸŽ´ Memory (matching countries)
- ðŸ”¤ Hangman (with a hardcoded word list)

## Background  

At the time, my goal was to practice JavaScript and gain hands-on experience by building complete, working projects that could run directly in the browser. JavaScript was the natural choice, since it worked without additional setup.

## Notes on the Code  

The code reflects the way I was programming back then. For example:

- In the Hangman game, the word list (300+ words) is hardcoded at the start of the main file.
- In the Memory game, the country data is also hardcoded in the main file, taking up dozens of lines.

This was the simplest solution for me at the time, but today I would organize these data sets into separate files or handle them differently.

## Looking Back  

Although I would now use a different structure (and maybe even a different programming language), Iâ€™m still satisfied with these projects as they show my early journey in web development. They demonstrate my willingness to learn by building real, working applications.

## Live Demo
